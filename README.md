## Project Description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game using python, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 


**Aim of the project**:
- Learn how to work with lists, random selection, user input, and conditional statements in Python.
- Practice taking user input and verifying its validity.
- Gain experience in version control using Git and GitHub.

**What I learned**:
- Basics of Git and GitHub for version control.
- Using Python's *'random'* module and *'input ()'* function.
- Error handling with *'if'* and *'else'* statements.

## Usage instructions
1. The script will be run providing a random name from a defined list.
2. The user will input a letter of their choice.
3. The program will validate the user input to check selection is valid.
4. If valid, the program will determine whether the letter is within the selected word.
5. The process repeats from step 2.
6. The user has a predetermined number of attempts to obtain all of the letters in the word.
7. Should the word be guessed, or the user have used all of their attempts, the game will end and the outcome will be provided to the user.
